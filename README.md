## Duration and Goals

- Completed over a period of **four weeks** (November ~ December 2023).

### Project Goals
<img src="screenshots/spreadsheet.png" alt="Spreadsheet" height="500">
The primary goal was to transform a cumbersome 300-line Google spreadsheet into a user-friendly web application powered by a MySQL database. The DKU Career Service Center initially managed student work information through Google spreadsheets, which presented several challenges:
1. Users had to open separate browser tabs for each position.
2. Lack of essential filtering options made searching inefficient.
3. Manual management of job postings led to outdated status information.

### Solution
To address these issues, the team developed a web platform that enables DKU students and faculty to:
- **Search and filter student worker positions easily.**
- **Apply directly through the website.**
- **Manage application statuses, conduct interviews, and streamline the hiring process with faculty authentication.**
- **Access statistical information about job postings.**

This platform significantly improved the efficiency and usability of managing student worker positions at DKU.
